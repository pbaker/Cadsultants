@B[@U(INTRODUCTION)]
@blankspace(2 lines) 
PC WorkWindow software adapts the IBM PC, XT, AT and most
IBM-type microcomputers for use as a full-function graphics
workstation to McDonnell Douglas' Unigraphics CAD/CAM system. PC
WorkWindow software performs all of the functions necessary to
communicate with a DEC or Data General host computer, running
Unigraphics - Communications, Graphics Emulation, Screen
Formatting, Crosshair Display, Keyboard Mapping, etc.
@blankspace(2 lines)  PC WorkWindow features dual-screen
operation, like that of expensive, yet less-flexible Unigraphics
workstations.  A standard PC monitor is used to display
Unigraphics prompts and menus in conventional format.  A
high-speed graphic controller & a high-resolution graphics
monitor are used to display Unigraphics parts and drawings. 
@blankspace(2 lines) 
The PC keyboard is specially programmed to emulate the
Unigraphics PFK/GFK.  Several optional devices are also available
for this purpose.  A graphic input device (mouse, joystick,
etc.) is used to control the graphics crosshair.  All interactive
Unigraphics functions are supported, as are enhanced functions -
file transfer, printer output, local zoom/pan, and more - which
have been added to PC WorkWindow software.

@newpage
@B[@UX(HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS)]
@blankspace(2 lines) 
PC WorkWindow requires the following minimum PC configuration:
@begin(verbatim)       - 256k RAM
       - 1 floppy diskette drive
       - 2 RS-232 serial ports
       - PC monitor & controller (MDA, CGA or EGA)
       - 1 free expansion slot (for graphic controller)
@end(verbatim)

Specific add-on graphics hardware, required by PC
WorkWindow software includes:
@begin(verbatim)	  -  A graphic controller board

		WYSE 700
		ARTIST MONOCHROME
		ARTIST 1
		ARTIST 1+
		ARTIST 10

	  -  A high-resolution, analog graphics monitor (color or mono)

		HITACHI
		MITSUBISHI
		AMTRON
		ARTSCREEN
		MONITRONIX
		WYSE
		Others are supported

	  -  A graphics input device

		SUMMAGRAPHICS 445 OPTICAL MOUSE
		CH PRODUCTS MICROSTICK JOYSTICK
		Others to be announced
@end(verbatim)

@newpage
@B[@UX(HOST CONNECTION)]
@blankspace(2 lines) The Unigraphics workstation configuration
file (UGFILES.DAT) should be modified to address the PC as a
model D100S/D90 workstation (refer to Unigraphics Documentation
pertaining to the addition of graphics workstations).  Baud rates
from 300 to over 19,200 are supported by PC WorkWindow and can be
set to match the desired host baud rate, by editing WORK.CFG - a
configuration file (see Appendix to this manual).
@blankspace(2 lines)
A single RS-232 serial connection (3-wire cable, modem, etc.)
should be made between the Unigraphics Host system and the COM1:
serial port of the PC.

@newpage
@B[@UX(HARDWARE INSTALLATION)]
@blankspace(2 lines) PC WorkWindow requires the installation of a
graphic controller board into an empty slot in the PC's expansion
chassis. Both 8- and 16-bit controllers are supported.  Please
refer to the manufacturer's instructions (packaged with the
controller) for details on this procedure.  PC WorkWindow System
Packages - which include the graphic controller and monitor - are
pre-configured and tested to ensure quick, trouble-free
installation.  Typically, all that is required after installing
the graphic controller board is to connect the monitor cables,
and turn on the power switch.
@blankspace(2 lines) PC WorkWindow System Packages also include a
serial I/O board for use with the graphic input device (also
supplied).  This board is defined as COM2: (standard address &
interrupt), with a 25-pin male DB25 connector.  The input device
connection can be made without adapters, gender changers, null
modems or jumper wires.

@newpage
@B[@UX(SOFTWARE INSTALLATION)]
@blankspace(2 lines)
PC WorkWindow is supplied on a single 5-1/4" low-density (360K
bytes) floppy diskette in MS-DOS format, as a single program file
named WORK.EXE.   A configuration file, named WORK.CFG is also
provided and is required at run-time.
@blankspace(2 lines)
WORK.EXE is SOFTWARE PROTECTED.  This does not mean that a backup
copy cannot be made; it does mean that the physical, ORIGINAL
diskette must be used when running the program from a floppy
drive, OR that a special program must be used to install WORK.EXE
on HARD DISK.  Once installed on hard disk, the floppy is not
required.
@blankspace(2 lines)
Floppy-drive users should make a COPY of the original diskette,
and store the COPY for safekeeping.  If WORK.EXE is accidentally
deleted from the ORIGINAL diskette, the backup diskette can be
used to re-copy the program back onto the original.  
@blankspace(2 lines)
Hard-drive users should run the A:HDUTIL.EXE
program.  HDUTIL will prompt the user through the hard disk
installation procedure.  Upon completion of HDUTIL's INSTALL
procedure, CREATE a directory named C:\WORK.  Then, COPY both
WORK.EXE and WORK.CFG from the ORIGINAL diskette to this
directory.
@blankspace(2 lines)
The configuration file, WORK.CFG, is a user-modifiable ASCII text
file which contains information about the graphic controller (the
first 12 lines), the host baud rate (line 13) and the mouse baud
rate (line 14).  These parameters are detailed in the Appendix to
this manual.

@newpage
@B[@UX(GENERAL OPERATION)]
@blankspace(2 lines) To begin Unigraphics operation, type in the
PC WorkWindow program name (WORK) followed by a carriage return
(PC ENTER key).  A "status line"  will appear at the bottom of
the PC monitor screen; a second carriage return should display
the normal operating system prompt from your DEC or DG host
computer.  Subsequent keyboard entry is transmitted to the host
computer, and echoed by the host to the PC screen.  If there is
no host response to keyboard input, re-check communication
parameters (baud rate) and the physical PC-to-Host connection.  
@blankspace(2 lines)
Once communication with the host computer has been established,
execute the normal command sequence used to run Unigraphics.  PC
WorkWindow will automatically display Unigraphics logon
information, followed by the usual Unigraphics menu options, on
the PC screen.  At this point, PC WorkWindow users should be
familiar with the PC WorkWindow keyboard layout, discussed in the
next section...

@newpage
@B[@UX(UNIGRAPHICS KEYBOARD LAYOUT)]
@blankspace(2 lines)  The PC keyboard is fully programmed for
Unigraphics operation (see appendix for illustration of PC
keyboard layout). The keyboard layout has been carefully designed
for efficient Unigraphics operation, albeit different than
conventional workstations which use a PFK/GFK.  The PC's
alphabetic keys are used to enter text, both upper and lower
case.  The top row numeric keys are used to enter numbers. The
numeric keypad is reserved for Unigraphics and PC WorkWindow
system control functions.
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Selecting Unigraphics Menu Options 1 through 14)
@blankspace(2 lines)
Unigraphics menu options 1 through 10 are selected using the
standard PC Function Keys labeled F1 through F10.  Unigraphics
menu options 11, 12, 13 and 14 require the use of the ALT key in
conjunction with F1, F2, F3 and F4 respectively.
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Selecting Unigraphics Functions)
@blankspace(2 lines) Unigraphics FUNCTIONS (as distinguished from
the 14 possible MENU OPTIONS) are selected using the ALT key in
combination with the first letter of the desired function.  For
example, Calculator is ALT-C, Display Control is ALT-D,
File/Terminate is ALT-F, etc.  This provides a simple-to-learn,
easy-to-use method of operation, when using a single keyboard. 
Furthermore, all Unigraphics FUNCTIONS and the ALT-Key
combination used to select them are displayed on the PC screen
(see section titled ALT-KEY Function Menu).
@blankspace(2 lines)
When running Unigraphics II, three exceptions to the ALT-first letter
scheme (described above) should be noted:
@blankspace(1 line)
@begin(verbatim)
                   Unigraphics Function    Alt-key

                   CHANGE MODULE           ALT 1
                   MODULE FUNCTION         ALT 2
                   MODULE PARAMETERS       ALT 3
@end(verbatim)

@newpage
@B(Unigraphics Control Keys)
@blankspace(2 lines) The Unigraphics software control functions
REJECT, ENTRY COMPLETE, TEMINATE, and ALTERNATE ACTION are
selected using the "cursor arrow" keys in the numeric keypad
section of the PC keyboard:

@begin(verbatim)			Unigraphics 		PC Key
			Control Function   

               REJECT              Left Arrow     
               ENTRY COMPLETE      Right Arrow    
               TERMINATE           Down Arrow      
               ALTERNATE ACTION    Up Arrow        
@end(verbatim)
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Convenience Keys)
@blankspace(2 lines)
Two additional keys for the frequently used functions, ZOOM and
REDISPLAY, are located in the numeric keypad area.  The first key
is labeled "Pg Up" and selects the Unigraphics REDISPLAY
function.  The second key is "Pg Dn" and selects the either the
Unigraphics ZOOM function or special workstation ZOOM (discussed
later), depending on the graphics controller being used. 
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B("ALT-KEY" Function Menu)
@blankspace(2 lines)
During Unigraphics operation, PC WorkWindow will indicate which
Unigraphics FUNCTIONS are available at any given time, and which
keys are used to select each function.  This ALT-KEY Function
Menu is displayed at the center of the PC screen.  The display of
this information can be alternately enabled/disabled by
selecting the END key on the PC keyboard. 
@blankspace(2 lines)
On the IBM PC and PC/XT, performance is generally improved when
the function menu display is disabled.
@blankspace(2 lines) A special ALT-KEY function, which does not
appear in the Function Menu is used to generate a view only,
graphics screen image, referred to as a Picture File.  ALT-P (for
Picture) will automatically cause Unigraphics to REDISPLAY the
current graphics image.  As graphics data is received and
displayed, it is also converted and stored on diskette/hard disk
in MS-DOS file format.  This vector file can be redisplayed by
any PC WorkWindow workstation, without being connected to the
Unigraphics host.  Local ZOOM/PAN functions may be used, if
supported by the hardware configuration.  Optional software is
available to redisplay Picture Files using MDA, CGA and EGA
display adapters, and for plottting on Hewlett-Packard Pen
plotters.
@newpage
@B[@UX(GRAPHICS INPUT DEVICE)]
@blankspace(2 lines)
The standard graphics input device supplied with PC WorkWindow is
the Summagraphics #445 optical mouse.  This mouse is configured
to operate at 1200 baud.  For use with other PC software, the
Summagraphics 445 emulates the PC Mouse from Mouse
Systems and the Microsoft Mouse.
@blankspace(2 lines)
The mouse is used to position the graphics screen crosshair.
Positional data is transmitted to the host by depressing the
space bar on the PC keyboard or the left-most mouse button.  The
middle and right-most mouse buttons are programmed to send the
Unigraphics functions REJECT  and ENTRY COMPLETE, and are
functional when the crosshair is displayed (see appendix for
illustration - Mouse Control Keys).
@blankspace(2 lines) The mouse buttons may have alternate meaning
when used to control local Zoom/Pan functions available with
certain graphics controllers.
@blankspace(2 lines) The ratio of movement between the graphic
input device and the screen crosshair is "adjustable".  Ten
(10) ratios are selectable, using the plus (+) and minus (-) keys
located on the numeric keypad.  The ratio may be changed ONLY
when the crosshair is visible, by increasing (plus key) or
decreasing (minus key) the default setting.  A "beep" will sound
indicating when either the minimum or maximum setting has been
reached.
@newpage
@B[@UX(WORKWINDOW SYSTEM CONTROL FUNCTIONS)]
@blankspace(2 lines)
The HOME key is used to access PC WorkWindow System Control
Functions. These functions appear in a "pop-up" window which
overlays the normal PC screen data.  When displayed, local
control functions may be selected using PC Function Keys F1 - F10.
@blankspace(2 lines)
PC WorkWindow System Control Functions appear as follows:
@begin(verbatim)
F1  Emulation Mode ....... D90/tektronix
F2  Screen Clear Mode .... scroll/FLASH
F3  Menu Display ......... COLOR/mono
F4  GraphText Hardcopy ... OFF/on
F5  DiskPrint File ....... CLOSED/open
F6  Display Picture File
F7  Read Color Table
F8  Write Color Table
F9  Clear Graphics Screen
F10 Exit to DOS


Each function is explained in more detail, below.

F1  Emulation Mode ....... D90/tektronix

    Used to select D90 or Tektronix 4014 emulation mode.  The
    default mode is D90, which is required to operate
    Unigraphics.  The 4014 mode can be used with other
    host-resident software packages which support this protocol. 

F2  Screen Clear Mode .... scroll/FLASH

    Used to select the manner in which the ARTIST 10 graphic
    controller memory is "erased".  FLASH mode - the default - is
    very fast, but produces a momentary flash which may be
    objectionable in certain lighting conditions.  In dark or dim
    lighting, the SCROLL option eliminates the flash, but
    executes somewhat slower.

    Note:  This option applies only to the ARTIST 10 controller,
    and will be eliminated in a subsequent software release.

F3  Menu Display ......... COLOR/mono

    Used to control the use of color for Unigraphics menu
    options.  Certain PC video controllers emulate the IBM Color
    Graphics Adapter (CGA) functions, but use a green/amber
    monitor.  Certain colors are not easily visible, without
    adjusting the brightness/contrast controls to near maximum.
    This often causes brighter colors to "burn" the screen.  When
    using such hardware, select the MONO option for a bright
    white/light grey character display (like that on conventional
    Unigraphics workstations), better suited to this
    configuration.

F4  GraphText Hardcopy ... OFF/on

    When turned ON, all alphanumeric data normally listed on the
    graphics monitor will also be sent to LPT1: - the primary PC
    printer port.  Output to the printer is buffered, allowing
    Unigraphics operation to continue without waiting for the
    printer to finish.  Care should be taken not to exit to DOS
    while printing data, since output will immediately cease.

F5  DiskPrint File ....... CLOSED/open

    This option will prompt for a PC filename, which will be
    created and opened for writing.  ALL subsequent printer
    output will be re-directed to this file.   This function can
    be i) used to "capture" Unigraphics menu screens using the
    Shift-PrtSc combination, ii) used in conjunction with
    GraphText Hardcopy to "capture" directory listings, GRIP
    programs, CL-files, etc., as they are displayed on the
    graphics monitor, iii) used with Tektronix mode to obtain OS
    file listings, UGFM output, etc.

F6  Display Picture File

    Used to display graphics images from diskette or hard disk,
    previously created by the Picture File function (ALT-P). 
    Images may be displayed using local zoom/pan operations,
    and/or plotted using thr PC WorkPLOT module.  Other options
    are currently being developed.

F7  Read Color Table

    Used to read a disk/diskette file, to change the current
    color palette settings.  See F8 - Write Color Table.

F8  Write Color Table

    Used to write the current color palette settings (as set by
    Unigraphics) to a PC file.  This file contains 3 lines for
    each of the 16 color values (48 lines total).   Each line
    will contain an integer from 0 - 16, which determines the
    relative intensity of the RED (1st line), GREEN (2nd line)
    and BLUE (3rd line) "guns" used to produce a particular color 
    on the graphics monitor.  This function was developed to
    allow UNIPIX screen images (saved with the Picture File
    function) to be re-displayed using alternate color palettes,
    for the purpose of output to a 35mm slide camera!

F9  Clear Graphics Screen

    Clears the graphic controller memory & display.

F10 Exit to DOS

    Terminates WORK.EXE in an orderly fashion and returns control
    to the MS-DOS operating system.  

    Incoming data (if any) from the host will be ignored.

    Unigraphics operation can be resumed without interruption
    (all serial interface signals are maintained, so that the
    host will not sense a terminal "disconnect"), by re-running
    WORK.EXE. The previously displayed Unigraphics menu will be
    restored, if using a CGA or EGA video controller.  If using
    an MDA (Monochrome Display Adapter), the Unigraphics screen
    will appear blank, however any valid Unigraphics menu option
    selection will generate a new display.
@end(verbatim)
@newpage
@B[@UX(Local Zoom/Pan)]
@blankspace(2 lines)
In addition to standard Unigraphics ZOOM/PAN/REGEN functions, PC
WorkWindow utilizes the hardware zoom, pan and scroll functions
built into the graphics processor chip of the graphic controller.
The Artist Monochrome, Artist 1 and Artist 1+ use the NEC 7220
graphics chip.  The Artist 10 controller uses the more powerful
Hitachi Advanced CRT Controller (ACRTC).  The Wyse 700 does not
support hardware Zoom/Pan capability. 
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Hardware Zoom)
@blankspace(2 lines)
In order to effectively use these functions, it is advantageous
to understand the underlying principles and procedures used...
@blankspace(2 lines) The hardware zoom technique used is commonly
called pixel replication or pixel "blossom".  Simply, the
controller magnifies the graphics image by doubling (for a 2x
zoom) the number of pixels in both the X and Y directions, and
ignoring that part of the image which extends beyond the screen
boundaries.  Zoom is incremental in nature; 2x, 4x, etc., and is
virtually instantaneous.  The entire drawing image may be
"panned" across the zoom window by moving the mouse/joystick.
Normal Unigraphics operation continues during these image
operations.  A possible disadvantage to pixel replication is the
effective loss of resolution as the zoom factor is increased. 
For this reason, PC WorkWindow limits hardware zoom to 4x (out of
16x); beyond this range, the image loses substantial detail and
becomes difficult to view.
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Display List Zoom)
@blankspace(2 lines)
The Artist 10, with its more advanced graphics chip, provides yet
another variation of local zoom.  This method uses a vector
display list, maintained in RAM or on hard disk, by PC WorkWindow
software.  As with hardware zoom, the user may select 1x, 2x or
4x magnification; in fact hardware zoom is employed to determine
the Zoom factor and drawing area to be viewed.  Hardware zoom
might be considered a "stepping stone" procedure to achieve
Display List Zoom.  When Display List Zoom is selected, hardware
zoom factors are reset, and the drawing is momentarily
redisplayed at full scale.  The Display File is immediately
processed by PC WorkWindow software, applying the necessary
transformation factors and coordinate offsets to generate a new
screen image.  Vector clipping is performed at high-speed by the
graphics hardware.  The advantage to this method is speed far
greater than Unigraphics ZOOM, without appreciable loss of
resolution.
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Zoom Control)
@blankspace(2 lines) The PC key labeled PgDn, located in the
numeric keypad section of most keyboards is used to access all
local zoom/pan operations - both hardware and display list
processing.  This same key will CANCEL and RESET the screen
display when selected a second time.   If the controller used
does not support local zoom/pan operations of any type, the PgDn
key simply invokes the Unigraphics ZOOM/PAN/REGEN function
(ALT-Z).
@blankspace(2 lines) When selected, PgDn will display a
rectangular Zoom Box on the graphics screen.  The Box can be
moved around the screen using the graphics input device.  For
simplicity, we shall assume this device to be the 3-button
Summagraphics 445 mouse.  Other devices work in a similar manner.
Depressing the left-most mouse button will INITIATE hardware
zoom; the image bounded by the Zoom Box will immediately be
enlarged to fill the screen.  The middle button will UNDO the
Zoom operation, and also ALTER the size of the Zoom Box prior to
zooming in.  The right-most button will FREEZE the current operation,
at whatever state the screen is in.  It may be helpful to view
the following table:
@begin(verbatim)
		Mouse Button		Zoom Function
	
		 LEFT			INITIATE
		 MIDDLE             UNDO/ALTER
		 RIGHT			FREEZE
@end(verbatim) During local Zoom operation, selecting any key on
the keyboard will also FREEZE the current display operation;
furthermore the key pressed will be transmitted to Unigraphics
for interpretation.
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Pan Control)
@blankspace(2 lines) Immediately after INITIATING hardware zoom,
but prior to a FREEZE operation, the entire original screen area
can be dynamically "panned" by moving the input device.  All of
the Zoom control keys remain in effect.
@blankspace(2 lines)
@B(Display List Zoom Control)
@blankspace(2 lines) Display List Zoom is activated by selecting
the left-most mouse button TWICE, during the Zoom operation; the
first time to INITIATE hardware zoom (& pan), and the second to
process the Display List.  Display List Zoom is CANCELLED & RESET
using the PgDn key, in exactly the same manner as hardware zoom. 
All Zoom operations cause a message to be displayed on the status
line of the PC monitor.

@newpage
@B(WORK.CFG)
@blankspace(2 lines)
WORK.CFG is an ASCII text file containing system configuration information.
A sample listing follows:
@begin(verbatim)
0		interlaced mode
64		active words
7		horizontal sync
3		vertical sync
3		horizontal front porch
9		horizontal back porch
3		vertical front porch
26		vertical back porch
768		active lines
768		display length
1024		maxx
768		maxy
12        baud rate factor for host
96        baud rate factor for graphics input device
@end(verbatim)
If you are using an ARTIST MONOCHROME, ARTIST 1 or ARTIST 1+
graphic controller, the first 12 lines of WORK.CFG are used to
properly initialize same, for use with a particular monitor.  A
monitor set-up sheet is included with each controller, and should
exactly match the contents of WORK.CFG.  If you are using an
ARTIST 10 controller, the first 12 lines of WORK.CFG are ignored,
although they must physically exist.
@blankspace(2 lines)
Line 13 is an integer "factor" used to set the baud rate for COM1: - the
Host serial port connection.
@blankspace(2 lines)
Line 14 is an integer "factor" used to set the baud rate for
COM2: - the Graphics Input Device serial port connection.
@blankspace(2 lines)
The following table lists all possible values for this parameter
and the corresponding baud rate:
@begin(verbatim)
		FACTOR FOR WORK.CFG				BAUD RATE

          384							300
		96 ------------------------------- 1200
		48							2400
		24 ------------------------------- 4800
		12							9600
		6 -------------------------------- 19200
		3						     38400
		2 -------------------------------- 56000

@end(verbatim)
The default setting for the Host port is 12 (9600 baud).  The
Summagraphics 445 mouse is hardwired for operation at 1200 baud
(a factor of 96) and should not be changed.  Other devices
(joysticks, trackballs, etc.) may require a change to this
parameter.
