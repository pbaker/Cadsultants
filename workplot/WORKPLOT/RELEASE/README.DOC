WorkPLOT II, Version 1.0 now supports direct plotter output, when
used with the CADSULTANTS-supplied serial interface board and
software driver.

Installation & Setup

Install the BOCA RESEARCH interface board as delivered.  The board
has a 9-pin serial connector and a 25-pin parallel connector. DO
NOT CONFUSE THE TWO WHEN CONNECTING THE SERIAL PLOTTER!

Use the BOCA RESEARCH diskette to run IOATFIG.EXE.  This program
is used to set the operational characteristics of the BOCA board:

		- Set PORT A to USER defined ADDRESS = 1E8 hex, with NO
            interrupt.
		- PORT B & the PARALLEL PORT should be disabled (for now).
          - EXIT and SAVE these settings

Use an AT-style 9-pin to 25-pin serial adapter cable to connect
the plotter to the PORT A connection (the small, 9-pin connecter
on the BOCA board).

Use the CADSULTANTS' WorkPLOT diskette to run PLOTTER.COM.  This
loads the special driver which WorkPLOT uses to locate the BOCA
serial port.  The driver will announce itself and return control
to DOS.  At this point, run WorkPLOT.COM  which should identify
itself as WorkPLOT II - Version 1.0.  Other versions will not
function with the BOCA board.

PLOTTER.COM SHOULD BE RUN ONCE AND ONLY ONCE AFTER BOOTING YOUR
PC.  Thereafter, WorkPLOT II can be run as many times as required.

The default WorkPLOT II Output Device is set to PLOTTER (this
replaces the earlier LPT: default).  Output to PLOTTER will be
directed to the BOCA port.

Currently, PLOTTER output is fixed at 9600 baud, no parity, 8
data bits and 1 stop bit; most HP plotters can be run with these
settings.  If other parameters are required, they can be changed
at the factory. (That's us!).  The next release of WorkPLOT II
will allow customer changes to communication parameters.  (Be
patient...  Good things take time!)

Good luck & happy plotting!
