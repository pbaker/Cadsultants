PC WorkPLOT

PC WorkPLOT converts Unigraphics screen images created by PC WorkWindow
software into Hewlett-Packard pen plotter format (HPGL). 

Once converted, HPGL output can be directed to the PC's serial or
parallel ports, the PC screen, or to a file on disk.  


Running PC WorkPLOT

To run PC WorkPLOT from the distribution diskette:

1)  Insert disk into drive A.
2)  Make sure your default drive is also A.
    You should have an "A>" prompt.
3)  Type WORKPLOT to execute the program.

WorkPLOT divides the screen into two windows.

The bottom window is used to display program control information,
key assignments, etc.

The top window displays program menu options and input prompts.

The keyboard layout for PC WorkPLOT is similar to PC WorkWindow:

          Function keys F1 thru F10 are used to select menu options.

          Arrow keys control menu display -

               Left arrow  - REJECT (display previous menu)
               Right arrow - ENTRY COMPLETE (display next menu)
               Down arrow  - TERMINATE (end program)

As indicated by the Main Menu displayed above, PC WorkPLOT will:

          Read data from the INPUT file named WORKPLOT.PIC

          Convert INPUT data into HP plot format for the
          Hewlett Packard #7586B pen plotter.

          Send the converted OUTPUT (HPGL) data to LPT1: (the
          1st parallel port)

In the conversion process, a SCALE of 1:1 will be maintained.  Automatic
pen selection will occur, in accordance with the current Pen Assignment
Table.

Brief explanations of each Main Menu option follow:

     1. Input File - Displays/Changes the INPUT filename.
                     Typically, this file is a screen image
                     (i.e., picture) file created by PC
                     WorkWindow, as generated by Unigraphics.

     2. Output Device - Displays/Changes the destination of plot data
                        generated by PC WorkPLOT.

                        Five options appear in the OUTPUT DEVICE submenu:

                              1.>LPT:          ( parallel port )
                              2. COM1:         ( RS-232 port   )
                              3. COM2:         ( RS-232 port   )
                              4. CRT           ( PC screen     )
                              5. Disk File
          
                        If the Disk File option is chosen, the user
                        will be prompted to enter a file specification.
@newpage
     3. Plotter Type - Displays/Changes the plotter to be used
                       for final output.

                       Seven (7) Hewlett-Packard plotters are supported:

                              1. HP7220A
                              2. HP7470A
                              3. HP7475A
                              4. HP7550A
                              5. HP7580B
                              6. HP7585B
                              7. HP7586B

                        Additional plotters can be added, and/or
                        changes made to existing plotter parameters
                        by editing WPPLOT.CFG (or a user defined 
                        plotter configuration file)

     4. Output Scale - Displays/Changes the scale of plotted data.

     5. Change Pen Assignments

        Hewlett-Packard plotters generally provide multiple-pen
        operation, and software controlled pen selection.
        PC WorkPLOT will generate an HP SELECT PEN command for
        every UG COLOR CHANGE command encountered in the input
        file.
      
        The user may assign the pen number corresponding to each
        UG color.

        Pen Assignment Tables are user defined.  See WPPENS.CFG

     6. Generate Output - Initiates the conversion process.

                          Output may be aborted by <CTRL>-C.

PC WorkPLOT Program Files

PC WorkPLOT consists of a single executable program (WORKPLOT.COM),
and three (3) configuration files (each with a .CFG extension).

Configuration files are read by WORKPLOT.COM at run-time, to set
initial program defaults including menu items, pen assignments,
and plotter parameters.  Defaults may be overridden at run-time.

The following configuration files are necessary to run PC WorkPLOT:
          
     WORKPLOT.CFG  - the master configuration file.  
     WPPENS.CFG    - pen assignment configuration file   (1)
     WPPLOT.CFG    - plotter configuration file          (2)

The contents of the three .CFG files may be changed by the user
to suit a particular operating environment.  

Note 1:  Alternate pen assignment configuration files may be
         specified by changing the filename specification in
         WORKPLOT.CFG

Note 2:  Alternate plotter configuration files may be specified
         by changing the filename specification in WORKPLOT.CFG

A description of the three configuration files follows.
@newpage
WORKPLOT.CFG

WORKPLOT.CFG is a 7 line ASCII file used to specify miscellaneous
operating parameters.  WORKPLOT.CFG also specifies the filenames
of 2 additional configuration files used by WORKPLOT.COM.

Line 1 - default INPUT file name.  Typically, the name of the
         screen image file created by PC WorkWindow.

Line 2 - default OUTPUT device/file.  An integer value is used
         to specify the output device/file in accordance with
         the following table:

         Value          Output Device

           1            LPT1: (Parrallel port  )
           2            COM1: (RS-232 port     )  (1)
           3            COM2: (RS-232 port     )  (1)
           4            CRT:  (computer screen )  
           5            Diskfile

        Note 1:   These options are not directly implemented in
                  this release of PC WorkPLOT.

                  Use the DOS MODE command to redirect LPT1: to 
                  either COM1 or COM2.

Line 3 - default PLOTTER type.  Initially, there are 7 Hewlett-
         Packard plotters supported.  An integer value is used
         to specify the plotter type in accordance with the 
         following table:

                   Value        HP Plotter Type

                     1              7220
                     2              7470
                     3              7475
                     4              7550
                     5              7580
                     6              7585
                     7              7586

Line 4 - default output SCALE.  Can be any real number.

Line 5 - name of pen assignment configuration file.
         (user specified; default = WPPENS.CFG)

Line 6 - name of output file if OUTPUT is directed to disk file.

Line 7 - name of plotter configuration file.
         (user specified; default = WPPLOT.CFG)

See Appendix for sample WORKPLOT.CFG file.
@newpage
WPPENS.CFG

WPPENS.CFG (or the user defined file named in WORKPLOT.CFG) maps
Unigraphics colors (1 thru 14 shown below) to the appropriate
plotter pen number.

This ASCII file contains 14 lines, 1 line for each UG color.
Each line contains a single integer value representing the
plotter pen number used to plot a particular color.

              UG Standard Color Table

                Number    Color
                   
                   1      Blue
                   2      Green
                   3      Cyan
                   4      Red

                  13      Dark Red
                  14      Aquamarine

See Appendix for sample WPPENS.CFG file.
@newpage
WPPLOT.CFG

WPPLOT.CFG (or the user defined file named in WORKPLOT.CFG) specifies
plotter types and parameters.

WPPLOT.CFG is an ASCII file structured as follows:

Line 1 - Plotter name to appear as menu option.

Line 2 - Conversion factor.  A real number used to convert
         screen image coordinates into HP plotter units.

         This value is used to obtain true scale.

Line 3 - X coordinate offset in plotter units.

Line 4 - Y coordinate offset in plotter units.

         Offsets are integer values which shift the plotter origin.

The plotter configuration file may contain up to 20 different
plotter specifications.  A plotter specification must use four 
lines and the information must be in the correct sequence.

See Appendix for sample WPPLOT.CFG file.

At the time of this release, the serial communications ports,
COM1: and COM2:, are not supported directly through PC WorkPLOT.
A temporary solution is to run one of the following batch files:

               LPT2COM1     or     LPT2COM2

LPT2COM1 will redirect line printer output to the COM1: serial
port and LPT2COM2 will redirect output to the COM2: port.  The
batch files will automatically execute the WorkPLOT program.  In
the PC WorkPLOT program, set the output device to be LPT:.
