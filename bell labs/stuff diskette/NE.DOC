Getting started fast

The Norton's Editor is a programmer's editor that's easy to
learn and use. You can start using it immediately, without
having to study this manual.

There are three things you need to know to get started fast:
how to start, how to end and how to get help in the middle.

Start the editor like this, with or without the name of a
file to edit:

NE
NE {filename}

End the editing session by pressing F3 followed by E (to
exit, saving the edited data) or F3 followed by Q (to quit
without saving your work).

To get help in the middle of your editing session, simply
press F1 to display the Norton Editor's help screens.

Here's a summary of the other Norton Editor function keys:

     F2   status display screen
     F3   lead in key for file & disk commands
     F4   lead in key for block commands
     F5   lead in key for screen & format commands
     F6   lead in key for miscellaneous commands
     F7   lead in key for printer commands
     F8   reserved for future use
     F9   DOS command processor
     F10  Reserved for future use

That's all you need to know to get started fast with the
Norton Editor. When your ready for more details, read the
rest of this manual.

General Information

Here is general information about the Norton Editor to help you 
understand its features, how the commands are organized, and
some of the philosophy that underlies the editor.

Important and Special Features

The Norton Editoe uses all of available memory so that none of
your computers resources go to waste. Typically, on a PC with
640K of memory, the editor can hold well over 500K of file data
in memory. Regardless of how much memory is available, The
Norton Editor can edit files of any size, no matter how large.
The editor can also handle unusually long lines, up to nearly
64K in size. You'll find that the Norton Editor places almost no
limits on the work it can do.

The Norton Editor has many features that are particularly useful
for writing programs. Among them are compressed display mode
(activated with F6 C), and automatic indentation (F5 I).

The Norton Editor also provides many features that make it
convenient for word processing as well. Among the word oriented
features are cursor movement by word, word-delete in either
direction, automatic word wrap when writing and paragraph
reformatting. 

The Norton Editor gives you access to DOS commands through a
command processor feature. You can perform any DOS command and
run any program using this feature.

The Norton Editor can be used with a mouse.

the Norton Editor can simultaneously edit two files, in separate editing
windows, and move data between them.

The Norton Editor can easily be configured and saved. You can make as many
customized versions of the editor as you wish, each configured
the way you want it.

Shift Key Notation.

Throughout this manual, Alt-X indicates key combinations that
are formed by holding down the Alt shift key followed by a
letter key. ^-X indicates key combinations that are formed by
holding down the Ctrl shift key followed by a letter key.

                              7
Shift Key Use


The Norton Editoe uses the Ctrl and Alt shift keys in a very
consistant manner; each shift key has a direction that it acts
in. The rule is simple:

	Ctrl is to the left or up, toward the top of the file.
	Alt is to the right or down, toward the bottom of the file.

It's easy to remember because it corresponds to their position
on the standard keyboard; Ctrl is above Alt so Ctrl goes up and
Alt goes down.

Among the examples of these two shift keys are used are the two
word deleting commands ^W and Alt-W. ^W deletes the word to the
left of the cursor; Alt-W the word to the right.

Command Structure

The editors command structure is primarily based on the use of
lead-in keys: a function key (F3-F7) followed by a letter key.
The function key "leads in" to the command. When the function
key has been pressed a brief, context sensitive help line
appears on the screens status line. You will find this command
structure quick and easy once you have become acquainted with it.

Here is a brief summary of the use of the function keys:

	F1 - help screens
	F2 - status display screens
	F3 - lead in key for file and disk commands
	F4 - lead in key for block commands
	F5 - lead in key for screen and format commands
	F6 - lead in key for miscellaneous commands
	F7 - lead in key for printer commands
	F8 - reserved for future use
	F9 - DOS command processor
	F10- reserved for future use

There are also a few commands that are based on Alt and Ctrl
shift keys.

Backup File Names

The Norton Editor has a special and useful way of dealing with
backup files. As do many editors, the Norton Editor saves the
existing file as the backup file, renaming it with the same name
but a differant extension. However the Norton Editor uses a
renaming scheme that preserves most of the original filename
extension and also allows you to edit a backup file. Instead of
giving the former file the extension of .BAK, the Norton Editor
shifts the extension one character and adds the character "~" at
the beginning of the extension. For example if we are working
with a file named SOURCE.ASM, after an editing session the
original file will be named SOURCE.~AS. If we edit that backup
file the original file becomes SOURCE.~~A.

During its operation, the Norton Editor uses a temporary file
with $ as the first character of its filename extension. The
rest of the temporary files name is the same as the name of the
backup file. You should be aware of this filename so that you do
not unintentionally delete it during the editing session.

STARTING THE NORTON EDITOR

The Norton Editor can be started in several different ways to
match your preferance. There are four parameters that you can
optionally specify when you start the editor:

	NE <starting line> <in file> <out file> </options>

The first parameter is used to have the editor start operation
with a jump to a given line number in the input file. The
<starting line> parameter is specified with a + sign followed by
the line number, for example: NE +100 INFILE. This feature is
particularly useful when your compiler has reported an error at
a particular line number in the program source. Using the
<starting line> you can immediately skip to that part of the
file. Ordinarily when the editor begins it displays a starting
message and pauses waiting for a keystroke. However, when you
use the <starting line> parameter, the editor immediately enters
the editing mode without pausing. You can also use this feature
to skip the opening message when starting the editor. Just
specify the starting line parameter as + without a line number,
and the editor will skip its starting screen and ump right into
the editing mode.

The second parameter, <input file>, is the one most commonly
used. If you do not provide the name of an input file in the
command line, the editor prompts you for one. If the <input file>
already exists, the editor reads it, otherwise the editor
creates a new file with that name.

The third parameter, <output file>, is used only when you wish
the editor to use a different name for the output file. If you
do not specify a separate output file, the editor uses the input
filename for the output filename. (As you'll see later, you can
switch to another output filename while you are editing; see the
F3 C command) The Norton Editor fully supports subdirectories,
so you can include drive and path names as part of the file
specifications.

The final parameter, </options>, generally won't have to be
specified. This parameter lets you specify special handling for
video display adapters that show "snow" when the screen is being
rewritten. The IBM Color Display, when being driven by the IBM
Color Graphics Adapter, is the typical example of a display that
"snows" with most programs. One of three arguments may be
specified for this parameter: /DA,


                               10

automatically adjust to display; /DB, never "desnow"; and /DC,
always "desnow". /DA is the default, meaning that when this
option is omitted, the Norton Editor will attempt to
automatically accommodate itself to the type of display you are
using. This option is saved with the F5 S command (save editor),
and needn't be specified after that unless you change displays.

In a very few special cases, you will want to specify the /DB or
/DC options. In particular, if you are using a 3270 PC, the
Sigma 400 or IBM Professional Graphics display adapters, the
Sharp 7000 or certain other LCD display machines, always use the
/DB option, never "desnow". You should also specify this option
if you computer "locks up" when you run the Norton Editor. If
you aren't using any of the adapters mentioned above, and your
display is showing "snow" with this argument omitted, you may
wish to try the /DC option, always desnow.

In some cases, the editor will perform desnowing when it is not
needed. If you think this is happening, using the /DB flag will
let the editor run faster and permit type ahead.
