Unigraphics Terminal Interface Program
New Release: 2.0a

I.  Program Operation

Release 2.0a of the UG interface program may be run as follows:

     1)  type UGSPEED <carriage return>

     2)  type UG2 <carriage return>

The first file (UGSPEED.BAT) is a simple macro which sets the
characteristics of the serial communication ports.

The second file (UG2.EXE) is the executable interface program.

No other files are required.
  

II.  Major Enhancments

SELECTIVE ERASE

Entities selected for REDISPLAY, BLANKING and similar operations
will be individually removed from the display.

KEYBOARD SETUP

Function Keys are now programmed directly by UG2.EXE.
The file named KB2.DAT is no longer required for this purpose.

The keyboard is de-programmed upon EXIT TO DOS.

LOGON MESSAGE

Upon executing UG2.EXE, a logon message will be displayed on the PC screen.
This message indicates whether the keyboard is setup for UGI or UGII, and 
instructs the user to switch input to the Graphics Display Keyboard.
    
TEXT MODE TOGGLE

The SELECT key is used to switch between large and small character size during
file maintenance and editing sessions.

This key will now cause a BEEP when LARGE TEXT is selected.







NEW KEY LOCATIONS  

   EXIT TO
   DOS -    Originally used the COMPOSE CHARACTER key.

            EXIT TO DOS is now moved to the top row
            function key marked F6 (next to File/Term).

   ESCAPE - Originally used the function key marked BREAK.

	       ESCAPE is now moved to the key NEXT to BREAK, which
            is marked GRAPH/TEXT.  This key is required by many
            UG error conditions in order to continue operation.

   BREAK -  The key marked BREAK (previously reprogrammed to
            send ESCAPE) has been returned to its original function.

            The BREAK key will now send a 250-300 millisecond break
            sequence to the Host computer.  This key is required
            by Data General computers.


OTHER CHANGES

A red LED on the Graphics Display Keyboard will now flash during
graphics screen regeneration.  The light indicates a momentary
keyboard lock condition required by certain program changes which
are otherwise transparent to the user.
